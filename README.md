# Epistemology
Yes, epistemology is a branch of philosophy that studies human knowledge, its nature, origin, scope and limits. The term comes from the Greek gnosis (knowledge) and logos (treatise or study), so it can be translated as the “study of knowledge.”

Epistemology asks how we know, what we can know and to what extent our knowledge is reliable. Explore fundamental questions, such as:


1. **The nature of knowledge**: What is knowledge and how does it differ from opinion or belief?
1. **The origin of knowledge**: Does it come only from experience (empiricism) or can it exist without it, like innate or rational knowledge (rationalism)?
1. **The limits of knowledge**: Can we know reality as it is, or are we limited by our perceptual and cognitive abilities?
1. **The validity of knowledge**: How do we know that what we think we know is true?

In the development of epistemology, many philosophers have contributed with different theories. For example, René Descartes' rationalism proposed that reason is the primary source of knowledge, while John Locke's empiricism held that knowledge is acquired through sensory experience.

## knowing subject

Yes, the knowing subject is a fundamental concept in philosophy and the theory of knowledge. It refers to the person or entity that carries out the act of knowing, that is, the one who perceives, understands, analyzes and processes information from the world around them. This term is used to highlight the capacity of human beings to be conscious and to acquire knowledge.

In the relationship of knowledge, the knowing subject is contrasted with the object of knowledge, which is what the subject tries to understand or know. In this process, the subject uses his or her cognitive faculties (such as perception, reasoning, and memory) to capture and structure information about the object, whether concrete (such as a natural phenomenon) or abstract (such as an idea or a concept). .

The concept of the knowing subject is central to epistemology and epistemology, as it involves profound questions about how knowledge occurs, to what extent the subject can really know the object as it is, and how factors such as perception and cultural context can influence that understanding.

## known object

Yes, the known object is that about which the knowing subject acquires knowledge or directs his cognitive attention. In the process of knowledge, the object is the "what" that one tries to understand, analyze or perceive, while the subject is the "who" that carries out the act of knowing.

The known object can be:

1. **Concrete**: something physical or material, such as a table, a tree, or a person. This type of object is accessible through the senses and direct experience.
1. **Abstract**: ideas, concepts, theories, or even emotions and feelings. These are not accessible in a tangible way, but are understood through reasoning and reflection.

## known object

In philosophy, the study of the relationship between the knowing subject and the known object is crucial, since it raises questions about the objectivity of knowledge. Can the subject know the object as it really is, or will his knowledge always be influenced by his individual perceptions and experiences? Furthermore, this analysis is important in the debate between realism and idealism.

## knowledge process

Yes, the knowledge process is the set of stages and mechanisms through which a subject acquires, understands, and structures information about an object or phenomenon, transforming it into knowledge. This process involves the interaction between the knowing subject and the object of knowledge and consists of several fundamental phases. Here are the most common steps of the knowledge process:


1. **Perception**: It is the first contact of the subject with the object through the senses. In this stage, the subject receives external stimuli (such as images, sounds, smells, etc.) that represent information about the object.

1. **Interpretation or conceptualization**:
 In this phase, the subject processes and organizes the information received, giving it meaning based on previous experiences, existing knowledge, and cognitive abilities. Here concepts and first ideas about the object arise.

1. **Judgment and reasoning**: The subject analyzes, compares, relates and evaluates the perceived information. This allows judgments to be made, conclusions to be drawn or inferences to be drawn. This stage is crucial to move from mere perception to a deeper and more reflective understanding.

1. **Synthesis and abstraction**: In this step, the subject integrates the different information and experiences obtained about the object, achieving a general or abstract understanding of it. This phase can give rise to more complex theories, hypotheses or ideas.

1. **Verification or verification**: In scientific knowledge, in particular, the subject usually subjects his conclusions to testing, experimentation or validation to determine whether the acquired knowledge is true or valid in other contexts.

1. **Application or communication**: Once the knowledge is consolidated, the subject can apply what has been learned in practice or share it with others. This allows knowledge to grow and be enriched in a community or culture.

This process can be repeated and fed back, since the knowledge acquired in one stage can be used to interpret and understand new objects or experiences. Furthermore, the knowledge process can vary according to areas (science, philosophy, art) and can be influenced by factors such as cultural context, subjectivity and individual perspective.

# Explanation of the Project

* **CognizantSubject**: Represents the subject that learns from objects. It implements a magic method `__add__` to combine skills, and a complex number is used as part of the skill attribute.
* **Knowledge Objects**: We use inheritance to create different types of knowledge (concrete and abstract), which the subject learns and stores in its knowledge base.
* **Decorator** `@log_learning`: Monitors the learning and logs each new acquisition of knowledge.
* **Context Manager** `learning_session`: Controls the opening and closing of each "learning session," helping to structure the process.
* **Generator** `idea_generator`: Produces new ideas sequentially, simulating the continuous emergence of knowledge.


# New features explained (v1.0.0.1)


1. Advanced Decorators:

* `time_learning`: Calculates the time it takes the subject to learn each object, providing feedback on the speed of learning.

* `attempt_counter`: Keep track of how many times the subject tries to learn the same object. This is useful to know if the subject has repeated attempts with a specific object.


1. Method `analyze_knowledge` in `CognizantSubject`

*  This method performs an advanced analysis of the subject's knowledge base, calculating the amount of concrete and abstract knowledge acquired. This function offers a structured summary of the knowledge that the subject has acquired.

1. New context manager `analysis_session`: 

* This manager simulates an "analysis session" in which an evaluation of the acquired knowledge is carried out. At the end of the analysis, a summary of the knowledge is printed.


This version of the project adds a system for detailed monitoring of the learning process and knowledge analysis. Additionally, with additional decorators and context managers, the project becomes more robust and adaptable for more complex learning and assessment scenarios.
