# Epistemology
Yes, epistemology is a branch of philosophy that studies human knowledge, its nature, origin, scope and limits. The term comes from the Greek gnosis (knowledge) and logos (treatise or study), so it can be translated as the “study of knowledge.”

Epistemology asks how we know, what we can know and to what extent our knowledge is reliable. Explore fundamental questions, such as:


1. **The nature of knowledge**: What is knowledge and how does it differ from opinion or belief?
1. **The origin of knowledge**: Does it come only from experience (empiricism) or can it exist without it, like innate or rational knowledge (rationalism)?
1. **The limits of knowledge**: Can we know reality as it is, or are we limited by our perceptual and cognitive abilities?
1. **The validity of knowledge**: How do we know that what we think we know is true?

In the development of epistemology, many philosophers have contributed with different theories. For example, René Descartes' rationalism proposed that reason is the primary source of knowledge, while John Locke's empiricism held that knowledge is acquired through sensory experience.
